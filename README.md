# Basics-of-Project-Management

The methodology for managing any project involves standardizing its execution. Today, there are established templates that help streamline project implementation, reducing common issues and ensuring a successful outcome. However, it's important to recognize that every project is unique, and while these methodologies offer valuable guidance, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Critical thinking and adaptability are still essential.


## Waterfall

This model is a linear and sequential approach to project management. It emphasizes completing each phase of a project—such as planning, design, development, and testing—before moving to the next. This methodology is best suited for projects with clear requirements and little expected change throughout the process.



## Agile

It is an iterative approach to project management, focusing on flexibility and continuous improvement. It breaks projects into smaller, manageable cycles called sprints, allowing teams to adapt to changes quickly. Agile promotes collaboration and regular feedback, making it ideal for projects where requirements may evolve over time.



## Scrum

It is a subset of Agile, designed to help teams work together more effectively. It emphasizes roles, responsibilities, and a structured process for managing work through iterative cycles, or sprints. Scrum focuses on delivering incremental progress through short, focused bursts of activity, encouraging team communication and accountability.
